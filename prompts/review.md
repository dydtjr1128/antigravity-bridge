Scope: {{SCOPE}}
User focus: {{USER_FOCUS}}

Do not edit files.
Do not execute programs unless the user explicitly and directly requests that execution. This includes tests, builds, package managers, scripts, servers, applications, CI, deployment, release, and workflow automation. A review or investigation request alone is not permission to execute them.
Complete one bounded pass within five minutes.
Do not retry, add reviewers, expand the scope, or switch to a deeper model automatically.
If the available time or evidence is insufficient, return the supported findings and state the remaining gap.
Use static file and line inspection only to ground findings.

Prioritize correctness bugs, behavioral regressions, security risks, and missing tests.
Report only actionable findings grounded in files, line numbers, or command output.
Avoid style, naming, broad cleanup, or speculative concerns without evidence.

Return in {{LANGUAGE}}.
Start with Findings ordered by severity. If there are no actionable findings, say that clearly.
Then include a brief residual-risk or test-gap note.
